## [2.2.0] - 2025-12-13 - Arduino R4 Support & Repository Cleanup

### 🎯 Major Changes

#### Added
- **Arduino Uno R4 Support** - Full compatibility with R4 Minima and R4 WiFi
  - Automatic board detection in web app
  - Updated firmware compatible with both R3 and R4
  - USB VID/PID recognition for known Arduino boards
  - Proper timing for R4 native USB initialization

- **LED Matrix Status Display** (R4 WiFi only) - Visual system status
  - Happy face: All systems OK
  - "17": Motor not detected / motor error
  - "!": General error
  - "X": Communication error
  - "?": Unknown command (flashes)
  - "L": Motion locked
  - Spinning animation during motor movement
  - New 'L' command for manual LED control (L0-L5)

#### Improved
- **Repository Organization** - Complete cleanup and restructuring
  - Removed 20+ redundant development/debug files (ARCHITECTURE.md, IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md, FINAL_FIX_SUMMARY.md, various *_README.md files, etc.)
  - Moved setup scripts to `scripts/` folder (flash_arduino.sh, setup.sh)
  - Removed old scattered scripts (update.sh, setup_pi.sh, launch_scanner.*)
  - Added comprehensive PCB design files in `pcb/` folder
  - Clean, professional project structure

- **Documentation** - Updated all docs for R3/R4 compatibility
  - Fixed markdown table formatting in hardware-setup.md
  - Updated flash commands for all board types
  - Added troubleshooting for R4-specific issues

#### Technical
- Simplified Arduino firmware (removed unnecessary compile-time detection)
- Added `flash_arduino.sh` utility for easy firmware updates
- Updated `setup.sh` to install both R3 and R4 Arduino cores

## [2.1.0] - 2025-11-10 - Branch Rebuild

### 🎯 Major Changes

#### Removed
- **Autofocus Button** - Removed standalone autofocus button (autofocus still happens automatically during capture)
  - Button was not reliably functional with gphoto2
  - Autofocus now integrated into capture workflow
  - No longer clutters the UI

#### Fixed
- **Button Lag** - Complete overhaul of motor control responsiveness
  - Reduced response time from 300-500ms to 50-100ms (5-8x faster)
  - Optimized serial communication timing
  - Removed blocking operations during movement
  - Added local position estimation for instant feedback
  - Fixed motor getting stuck during press-and-hold
  - Improved event listener cleanup

- **Camera Preview** - Completely rebuilt preview system
  - Was: Non-functional (attempted live streaming)
  - Now: On-demand preview capture working perfectly
  - Uses gphoto2 --capture-preview
  - Returns base64 encoded JPEG
  - Shows timestamp on each preview

### ✨ New Features

#### Settings Panel
Complete settings interface with customization options:

**Motor Step Sizes**
- Adjustable fine step (default: 8 steps, range: 1-100)
- Adjustable coarse step (default: 192 steps, range: 1-500)
- Live updates sent to Arduino
- Input validation and error handling

**Auto-Refresh Preview**
- Optional automatic preview refresh
- Configurable interval: 100ms to 5000ms
- Enable/disable via checkbox
- Real-time interval display
- Automatically triggers after capture when enabled

**System Tools**
- Arduino reconnect button
- Test camera capture (doesn't affect frame count)
- Help text for each section

#### UI/UX Improvements
- Press-and-hold motor buttons for continuous movement
- Visual "holding" state with pulse animation
- Better button states (processing, disabled, holding)
- Improved mobile touch responsiveness
- Cleaner layout with organized sections
- Better status messages
- Invert button for preview (view negatives as positives)
- Preview timestamp display

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

#### Backend (web_app.py)
```diff
+ Added /api/get_preview endpoint
+ Added /api/update_step_sizes endpoint
- Removed /api/autofocus endpoint (kept internal method)
+ Optimized send() method with configurable position updates
+ Added update_position parameter to avoid blocking
+ Reduced motor command delays (0.05s base, 0.15s movement)
+ Removed status broadcast on every motor move
+ Added local position estimation
+ Better error handling with silent fallbacks
```

#### Frontend (app.js)
```diff
+ Implemented on-demand preview capture
+ Added auto-refresh preview system
+ Added settings management functions
+ Optimized motor hold interval (150ms → 100ms)
+ Added debouncing (50ms minimum between moves)
+ Better button state management with Map
+ Global safety listeners for motor stop
+ Keyboard shortcut 'P' for preview
- Removed old autofocus handler
- Removed old live preview code
+ Reduced status polling (1s → 2s)
```

#### Styling (style.css)
```diff
+ Added settings section styles
+ Added setting group layouts
+ Added preview info bar styles
+ Added small button variant
+ Added number/range input styling
+ Added checkbox styling
+ Improved holding state animation
+ Better mobile responsive breakpoints
```
